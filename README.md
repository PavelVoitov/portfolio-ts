# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository hosts the code for my personal portfolio website.

## About the Project

This portfolio website showcases my skills and provides links to my projects for your reference. It was developed using the following technologies:

- **React:** The entire frontend of the website is built using the React library, providing high flexibility and performance.

- **TypeScript:** All the code is written using TypeScript to improve type safety and make maintenance easier.

- **Sass:** The website's styling is done using the Sass preprocessor, allowing for structured and easily customizable styles.

The backend for the email functionality is implemented in a separate repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/PavelVoitov/portfolio-gmail-smtp.git).
